# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

orginally had generateHTML.js as a separate file that the index required, but when the initial questions prompt began and the HTML file was generated, the endHTML function would run first and the startHTML function would not run at all. So I moved the generate HTML functions into the index.js file, and it worked properly.

chose not to go the PATH route to generate the HTML because I don't fully understand it yet.
